### Notes
For the most part, the only issue encountered was resolving the icon issue with collection view; I wasnt able to figure the issue with the icons, but the hint helped at the end. There is also an issue present with the Now Playing tab when someone taps on a movie for information; unfortunately the background for the details screen is transparent/adaptive to the users settings, so there is a visual error when oving to the details screen. I actually like the effect an it doesnt hinder use, so this will be resolved if a bit. As for additional features, they weren implemented as this week was rather troublesome. Do plan to implement in the future however.

### Notes
One specific challenge I encountered when creating this app was the curious top and bottom (maybe lateral as well but this wasnt investigated) padding in the "Labels" object, towards which synopises (in my project, "descriptions") were unusually spaced relative to the dimensions set by the image and relative layout. In the synopsis label, there appeared to be extra padding on the top and bottom which made a cut (with ...) paragraph appear unusual. Im unsure if this is rather due to the line amount, as I experimented both with 0 and some specific number, but still encounterd this issue with visually-appropriate line amounts. In the end I let it be and resized my picure, so the spacing wasn't too apparent, but im still curious on why this was.
