### Notes
One specific challenge I encountered when creating this app was the curious top and bottom (maybe lateral as well but this wasnt investigated) padding in the "Labels" object, towards which synopises (in my project, "descriptions") were unusually spaced relative to the dimensions set by the image and relative layout. In the synopsis label, there appeared to be extra padding on the top and bottom which made a cut (with ...) paragraph appear unusual. Im unsure if this is rather due to the line amount, as I experimented both with 0 and some specific number, but still encounterd this issue with visually-appropriate line amounts. In the end I let it be and resized my picure, so the spacing wasn't too apparent, but im still curious on why this was.
